# Enhanced Malaria Forecasting Project with Environmental Data

## Project Overview

This enhanced malaria forecasting system integrates real environmental data (temperature, humidity, precipitation) from NASA POWER API with actual malaria case data from Agona West, Ghana (2019-2024). The system now provides more accurate predictions by incorporating climate factors that influence malaria transmission.

## Key Enhancements

### üå°Ô∏è Environmental Data Integration

### üìä Data Processing Improvements
- **Yearly Aggregation**: Converted to yearly totals for consistency with provided dataset
- **Feature Engineering**: Added lag features for both malaria cases and environmental variables
- **Data Fusion**: Merged health records with environmental data using temporal alignment

### ü§ñ Enhanced Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regression with environmental features
- **Features**: 
  - Temporal components (year)
  - Lag features (1-2 years for cases and environmental data)
  - Environmental variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
- **Training**: 2019-2023 data
- **Testing**: 2024 data
- **Forecasting**: 2025 prediction

## Model Performance

### Current Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 19,977.44 cases
